# abouts my game.
my game is made by python using pygame libraries. It is a super fun game. As I belong from Bangladesh, I created this game called " Hasina eating money ". This game is about a faci**t political person Sheikh hasina. He killed a lot of students in the July revolution. She siphoned a lot of money of Bangladesh and that is what this game about. there is button. to start the game, click "start" button. Move your player(Hasina) by left and right button and make her eating money. you score 1 point for each money. when you missed, game is over and click try again button to play again.
